Yet another fucked, interpreted programming language you never asked for

#syntax ideas
```
variable foo ?= 5 #50% chance of being 5

# All statements are build like this .. i.e. (if foo, 5) same as (if foo == 5) ...
# Again, it's kinda random what statement you'll get ...
statement foo, 5 do
  foo ?= 5 operator 3 # *winky face*
stop
```
